# Merge Sort Demonstrated in C++ 

Merge sort is an efficient, general-purpose, comparison-based sorting algorithm. That Use n* log (n) complexity 

Quick Sort is an efficient strong sort with worst case complexity of NÂ² and Average complexity n *log (n)

## How To Use ?

Just Run the C++ with any compiler you favour and Call the QuickSort or Merge Sort Function \
Merge Sort : mergesort(ArrayToBeSorted,LeftIndex,RightIndex)

Quick Sort : quicksort (ArrayToBeSorted,LeftIndex,RightIndex)




## Softwares Needed 

```C++
Visual Studio 2010 or Higher 
```
